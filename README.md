## How to run Coding assignment?

#### I used a conda environment as you can see in requirements.txt

#### Run main.py

## Sql Questions

#### In sql_questions dir

## disclaimer:

###### I did not have time to write a nice readme file, nor did I have time to deliver the code as an api, write logs, and debug the code well.
###### I did the sql questions very fast because I was out of time  

#### sorry for that, I was a bit nervous
#### I realy do think though that I could answer the questions well
